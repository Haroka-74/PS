# **Spanning Trees**
- *In graph theory, a spanning tree of an undirected graph `G(V, E)` is a subgraph that is a tree (acyclic) and includes all vertices of `G(V, E)`*

# **Minimum Spanning Trees**
- *In graph theory, a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph `G(V, E)` is a spanning tree with the minimum possible sum of edge weights*
    - *Kruskal’s Algorithm is a greedy method used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph by selecting edges in ascending order of weight while avoiding cycles*

    - *Prim’s Algorithm is a greedy method used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph by starting from a node and growing the tree by adding the smallest edge connecting a visited node to an unvisited node*
